	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to run as the input size increases. Algorithms with lower time complexity are considered more efficient.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run relative to the input size. An efficient algorithm should not only have a low time complexity but also use memory efficiently. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) requires memory proportional to the input size.</p>
